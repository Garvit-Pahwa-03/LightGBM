# Customer Purchase Prediction using LightGBM
This project was developed as part of the **Appian Hackathon**, with the objective of predicting whether a customer will purchase a new product based on their historical purchase behavior. Using a dataset containing previous customer purchases, we built a machine learning pipeline using **LightGBM** for binary classification.
